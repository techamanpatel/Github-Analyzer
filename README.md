#GITHUB ANALYSIS
Welcome to Project Name! This project allows you to integrate GitHub API and GitHub OAuth for authentication. To run this project locally, you need to configure your environment variables.

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Node.js (version >= 14.x)

GitHub API token

GitHub OAuth credentials (Client ID and Secret)

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
[git clone https://github.com/techamanpatel/Github-Analyzer.git
cd project-name
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Create the .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

env
Copy
Edit
# GitHub API Configuration
# Get your token from https://github.com/settings/tokens
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token

# Server Port Configuration
PORT=3000

# GitHub OAuth Configuration
# Create an OAuth app at https://github.com/settings/developers
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback

# Session Secret (for cookie encryption)
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret
3.1. GitHub API Token
Get your personal access token from GitHub:

Go to GitHub Personal Access Tokens and generate a new token with the required scopes (typically "repo" and "user" permissions).

3.2. GitHub OAuth App
Create an OAuth application in your GitHub developer settings:

Go to GitHub Developer Settings and register a new OAuth App.

Set the callback URL to http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback.

Note down the Client ID and Client Secret.

3.3. Session Secret
For security, the session secret should be a strong, random string. You can generate one using any password manager or a random string generator.

4. Run the Project Locally
Once you've set up the .env file, you can run the project locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The server will start on http://localhost:3000.

üöÄ Features
GitHub API Integration: Fetch user data from GitHub.

GitHub OAuth Authentication: Securely authenticate users using their GitHub accounts.

Session Management: Persistent user sessions with encrypted cookies.

üîê Important Notes
Do not commit your .env file to version control. Add it to .gitignore to keep it secure.

bash
Copy
Edit
# .gitignore
.env
Ensure that your GITHUB_API_TOKEN and other credentials are kept secure and not shared publicly.
